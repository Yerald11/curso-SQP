Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation.

The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM.

In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles.

Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181077163"

In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue).

To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc.

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169105449"

Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol. The results demonstrated that agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel is a promising adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes from water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085978307"

To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201409987"
