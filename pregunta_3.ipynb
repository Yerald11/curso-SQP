The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° < 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.   \n",

In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.   \n",

The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces.

Polysaccharide-based gel beads are preferred for their uniform shape and size, large specific surface area, and easy separation by filtration and subsequent reuse. In this work, we prepare and rheologically characterize UV-active κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads for the adsorption and degradation of dyes. The 3–4 mm sized nanocomposite beads are formed by the extrusion of κ-carrageenan/TiO2 gel solution in salt solutions. The maximum increase in modulus was observed with the addition of 1% w/v TiO2 to κ-carrageenan and subsequent crosslinking with mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads crosslinked by mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2 have higher adsorption capacity, as compared to beads crosslinked with single salt of KCl. The kinetic study indicated the chemisorption of Methylene Blue on the bead surface. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads showed higher degradation for Methylene Blue and Nile Blue A than Rhodamine B in 5 and 50 ppm each multicomponent dye systems under UV irradiation. The κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads could form a porous column for the selective adsorption of positively charged dyes from a multicomponent dye system. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers.   \n",

A hybrid nanocomposite has also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the κC-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species. The study indicates that the synthesized adsorbents have potential applications for the removal of dyes and metal ions from wastewater. © 2020   \n",

The ZHC was synthesized via the graft-copolymerization technique using the crosslinked hydrogel of KC as polymer matrix. Effects of incorporating zeolite particles within the hydrogel matrix on the properties were studied using different characterization techniques such as TEM, X-ray diffraction, SEM and FTIR. The hydrogel composite with 8% loading of zeolite exhibited maximum swelling capacity (3.481%) among the synthesized ZHCs. For MB removal, ZHC adsorbed 99% dye with 0.4 g L−1 adsorbent dose in the neutral pH solution. Furthermore, the adsorption of MB onto ZHC followed pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.   \n",

The CP was synthesized free radically from its monomers N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), acrylic acid (AA) and methylene bis-acrylamide (MBA) crosslinker comonomer in the presence of KC in water. The adsorbents were characterized and used for separation of Safranine T (ST) and brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) cationic dye mixtures from water. The synthesis and process parameters for adsorption were optimized with central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Accordingly, the CPKC bio-composite adsorbent with optimized composition of 2.5 wt% of KC, 1.5 wt% of MBA and NVP: AA molar ratio of 1.3:1 showed a high adsorption capacity of 362.5 mg/g for ST and 398 mg/g of BCB dye for a binary mixture containing 100 mg/L each of the dye in a solution pH of 7 and adsorbent dose of 0.25 g/L. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased. The swelling rate of the hydrogels was improved by introducing sodium carbonate as pore-forming agent. The prepared superadsorbent composites were used as adsorbent for a cationic dye, methylene blue. Isotherm of adsorption and the effect of pH, adsorption dosage, contact time and initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were also studied. The results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue on the prepared adsorbents is 156.25 mg g−1 and adsorption is well-described by Langmuir isotherm model. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.   \n",

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)   \n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration.

In this work, we have used repeated alkali solubilization and acid precipitation for an agricultural and forestry by-product, bilberry kernel shells, to obtain Mountain apricot shell Melanin (Mas-Mel), which can be used for the adsorption of cationic dyes. By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles. Our results may provide a new strategy for the development of green bio-based adsorbent materials and industrial dye wastewater treatment. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers   \n",

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process.

Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking.

Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.   \n",

Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023   \n",
              "17  This study addresses the critical issue of removing toxic dyes from industrial wastewater to protect the environment and human health. To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&#x02009;±&#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&#x02009;±&#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.   \n",

The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite showed a much higher adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) than the cellulose and cellulose/TiO2 composite. The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite also degraded MB more efficiently in aqueous solution than the cellulose/ TiO2 composite. The MB adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite increased linearly with increasing carrageenan content in the composites. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.   \n",

Novel carrageenan and itaconic acid-based superadsorbent hydrogel having appreciable swelling properties and adsorption capacity towards Methylene blue (MB), Crystal violet (CV), and Methyl Red (MR) was synthesized by suspension polymerization technique. The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively. Thermodynamic studies revealed the spontaneous nature of the undertaken dye adsorption experiment. Overall, the present study reveals that the synthesized superadsorbent hydrogel can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of dyes from an aqueous solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.   \n",

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites. The experimental equilibrated adsorption capacity of nanocomposites was analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The results corroborated that the experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm the best.   \n",

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic.

Under optimized reaction conditions, GT-CAG-cl-polyAA displayed 486 % maximum swelling percentage. TEM image depicted wrinkled silk veil wave-type surface morphology of graphene oxide (GO), whereas, the SEM analysis indicated the porous nature of the GT-CAG-cl-polyAA and GOHNC capable of accumulating a large number of water/dye molecules. GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022   \n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.   \n",

Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol.

To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.   \n",

              "      <td>In this study, cationic starch-carrageenan‑sodium alginate (CAS/CR/SA) hydrogels with different weight ratios of carrageenan and sodium alginate were prepared and their properties such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheological properties, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and methylene blue adsorption test were measured. The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° &lt; 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

              "      <td>κ-Carrageenan (κC) is a widely used food hydrogel, but its use as an environmental adsorption separation material still needs to be further developed. Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Kappa -carrageenan hydrogel containing numerous functional groups used as an environmental-friendly adsorbent shows limitations due to its high water solubility, low gel strength and low regeneration ability. In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.</td>\n",

The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The ΔGoad was negative indicating spontaneous physisorption for the three dyes. The prepared hydrogel being environmentally friendly also showed an improved ability to adsorb the organic dyes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</td>\n",

Polysaccharide-based gel beads are preferred for their uniform shape and size, large specific surface area, and easy separation by filtration and subsequent reuse. In this work, we prepare and rheologically characterize UV-active κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads for the adsorption and degradation of dyes. The 3–4 mm sized nanocomposite beads are formed by the extrusion of κ-carrageenan/TiO2 gel solution in salt solutions. The maximum increase in modulus was observed with the addition of 1% w/v TiO2 to κ-carrageenan and subsequent crosslinking with mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads crosslinked by mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2 have higher adsorption capacity, as compared to beads crosslinked with single salt of KCl. The kinetic study indicated the chemisorption of Methylene Blue on the bead surface. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads showed higher degradation for Methylene Blue and Nile Blue A than Rhodamine B in 5 and 50 ppm each multicomponent dye systems under UV irradiation.

A hybrid nanocomposite has also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the κC-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species.

The ZHC was synthesized via the graft-copolymerization technique using the crosslinked hydrogel of KC as polymer matrix. Effects of incorporating zeolite particles within the hydrogel matrix on the properties were studied using different characterization techniques such as TEM, X-ray diffraction, SEM and FTIR. The hydrogel composite with 8% loading of zeolite exhibited maximum swelling capacity (3.481%) among the synthesized ZHCs. For MB removal, ZHC adsorbed 99% dye with 0.4 g L−1 adsorbent dose in the neutral pH solution. Furthermore, the adsorption of MB onto ZHC followed pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</td>\n",

The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased.

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)</td>\n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration. As per Langmuir model, maximum adsorption was observed to be 132 mg/g for Ala: Car: GO ratio of 2:2:1. The dye absorption followed langmuir adsorption isotherm. The synthesized hydrogel beads show multi-functionalities (double network of polymers and graphene oxide) as such may potentially be used for removal of harmful dyes from the waste water as well as from aqueous waters. © 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers</td>\n",

In this work, we have used repeated alkali solubilization and acid precipitation for an agricultural and forestry by-product, bilberry kernel shells, to obtain Mountain apricot shell Melanin (Mas-Mel), which can be used for the adsorption of cationic dyes. By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles.

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process. The properties of CAR-DTAB in this research proposed a facile way to prepare stable CAR composite by cross-linking with quaternary ammonium surfactant. © 2023 AOCS.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The study explores the use of hydrochar-derived activated carbon (AC) to improve the adsorption capacity and mechanical properties of carrageenan (CAR) hydrogel beads. Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking. The study highlights enhanced adsorption capacity of carrageenan hydrogel via carrageenan/activated carbon composites, providing cost-effective wastewater treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Methylene blue (MB), a common dye in the textile industry, has a multitude of detrimental consequences on humans and the environment. Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.</td>\n",

Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023</td>\n",

To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&amp;#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&amp;#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&amp;#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&amp;#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</td>\n",

The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite also degraded MB more efficiently in aqueous solution than the cellulose/ TiO2 composite. The MB adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite increased linearly with increasing carrageenan content in the composites. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</td>\n",

Novel carrageenan and itaconic acid-based superadsorbent hydrogel having appreciable swelling properties and adsorption capacity towards Methylene blue (MB), Crystal violet (CV), and Methyl Red (MR) was synthesized by suspension polymerization technique. The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively. Thermodynamic studies revealed the spontaneous nature of the undertaken dye adsorption experiment. Overall, the present study reveals that the synthesized superadsorbent hydrogel can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of dyes from an aqueous solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites. The experimental equilibrated adsorption capacity of nanocomposites was analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models.

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic.

GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022</td>\n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Water pollution caused by dyes is a significant global problem. Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol. The results demonstrated that agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel is a promising adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes from water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The contamination of water by organic dye compounds are worldwide environmental problem due to their highly toxic nature. To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.</td>\n",

              "0  In this study, cationic starch-carrageenan‑sodium alginate (CAS/CR/SA) hydrogels with different weight ratios of carrageenan and sodium alginate were prepared and their properties such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheological properties, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and methylene blue adsorption test were measured. The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° < 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° < 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.   \n",

In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.   \n",

The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The ΔGoad was negative indicating spontaneous physisorption for the three dyes. The prepared hydrogel being environmentally friendly also showed an improved ability to adsorb the organic dyes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.   \n",

Polysaccharide-based gel beads are preferred for their uniform shape and size, large specific surface area, and easy separation by filtration and subsequent reuse. In this work, we prepare and rheologically characterize UV-active κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads for the adsorption and degradation of dyes. The 3–4 mm sized nanocomposite beads are formed by the extrusion of κ-carrageenan/TiO2 gel solution in salt solutions. The maximum increase in modulus was observed with the addition of 1% w/v TiO2 to κ-carrageenan and subsequent crosslinking with mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads crosslinked by mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2 have higher adsorption capacity, as compared to beads crosslinked with single salt of KCl. The kinetic study indicated the chemisorption of Methylene Blue on the bead surface. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads showed higher degradation for Methylene Blue and Nile Blue A than Rhodamine B in 5 and 50 ppm each multicomponent dye systems under UV irradiation. The κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads could form a porous column for the selective adsorption of positively charged dyes from a multicomponent dye system. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers.   \n",

A hybrid nanocomposite has also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the κC-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species. The study indicates that the synthesized adsorbents have potential applications for the removal of dyes and metal ions from wastewater. © 2020   \n",

The ZHC was synthesized via the graft-copolymerization technique using the crosslinked hydrogel of KC as polymer matrix. Effects of incorporating zeolite particles within the hydrogel matrix on the properties were studied using different characterization techniques such as TEM, X-ray diffraction, SEM and FTIR. The hydrogel composite with 8% loading of zeolite exhibited maximum swelling capacity (3.481%) among the synthesized ZHCs. For MB removal, ZHC adsorbed 99% dye with 0.4 g L−1 adsorbent dose in the neutral pH solution. Furthermore, the adsorption of MB onto ZHC followed pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.   \n",

The CP was synthesized free radically from its monomers N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), acrylic acid (AA) and methylene bis-acrylamide (MBA) crosslinker comonomer in the presence of KC in water. The adsorbents were characterized and used for separation of Safranine T (ST) and brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) cationic dye mixtures from water. The synthesis and process parameters for adsorption were optimized with central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Accordingly, the CPKC bio-composite adsorbent with optimized composition of 2.5 wt% of KC, 1.5 wt% of MBA and NVP: AA molar ratio of 1.3:1 showed a high adsorption capacity of 362.5 mg/g for ST and 398 mg/g of BCB dye for a binary mixture containing 100 mg/L each of the dye in a solution pH of 7 and adsorbent dose of 0.25 g/L. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased. The swelling rate of the hydrogels was improved by introducing sodium carbonate as pore-forming agent. The prepared superadsorbent composites were used as adsorbent for a cationic dye, methylene blue. Isotherm of adsorption and the effect of pH, adsorption dosage, contact time and initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were also studied. The results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue on the prepared adsorbents is 156.25 mg g−1 and adsorption is well-described by Langmuir isotherm model. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.   \n",

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)   \n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration. As per Langmuir model, maximum adsorption was observed to be 132 mg/g for Ala: Car: GO ratio of 2:2:1. The dye absorption followed langmuir adsorption isotherm. The synthesized hydrogel beads show multi-functionalities (double network of polymers and graphene oxide) as such may potentially be used for removal of harmful dyes from the waste water as well as from aqueous waters. © 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers   \n",

In this work, we have used repeated alkali solubilization and acid precipitation for an agricultural and forestry by-product, bilberry kernel shells, to obtain Mountain apricot shell Melanin (Mas-Mel), which can be used for the adsorption of cationic dyes. By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles.

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process.

Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking.

Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.   \n",

Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023   \n",
              "17  This study addresses the critical issue of removing toxic dyes from industrial wastewater to protect the environment and human health. To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&#x02009;±&#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&#x02009;±&#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.   \n",

The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite showed a much higher adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) than the cellulose and cellulose/TiO2 composite. The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite also degraded MB more efficiently in aqueous solution than the cellulose/ TiO2 composite. The MB adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite increased linearly with increasing carrageenan content in the composites. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.   \n",

Novel carrageenan and itaconic acid-based superadsorbent hydrogel having appreciable swelling properties and adsorption capacity towards Methylene blue (MB), Crystal violet (CV), and Methyl Red (MR) was synthesized by suspension polymerization technique. The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively.

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites. The experimental equilibrated adsorption capacity of nanocomposites was analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The results corroborated that the experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm the best.   \n",

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic.

Under optimized reaction conditions, GT-CAG-cl-polyAA displayed 486 % maximum swelling percentage. TEM image depicted wrinkled silk veil wave-type surface morphology of graphene oxide (GO), whereas, the SEM analysis indicated the porous nature of the GT-CAG-cl-polyAA and GOHNC capable of accumulating a large number of water/dye molecules. GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022   \n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.   \n",

Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol.

To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.   \n",

The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° &lt; 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

              "      <td>κ-Carrageenan (κC) is a widely used food hydrogel, but its use as an environmental adsorption separation material still needs to be further developed. Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Kappa -carrageenan hydrogel containing numerous functional groups used as an environmental-friendly adsorbent shows limitations due to its high water solubility, low gel strength and low regeneration ability. In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Bacterial cellulose (BC)/kappa carrageenan (κ-C) hydrogel was synthesized via in-situ method by inoculating the κ-C into the Acetobacter xylinum cell culture medium. The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The ΔGoad was negative indicating spontaneous physisorption for the three dyes. The prepared hydrogel being environmentally friendly also showed an improved ability to adsorb the organic dyes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</td>\n",

Polysaccharide-based gel beads are preferred for their uniform shape and size, large specific surface area, and easy separation by filtration and subsequent reuse. In this work, we prepare and rheologically characterize UV-active κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads for the adsorption and degradation of dyes. The 3–4 mm sized nanocomposite beads are formed by the extrusion of κ-carrageenan/TiO2 gel solution in salt solutions. The maximum increase in modulus was observed with the addition of 1% w/v TiO2 to κ-carrageenan and subsequent crosslinking with mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads crosslinked by mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2 have higher adsorption capacity, as compared to beads crosslinked with single salt of KCl. The kinetic study indicated the chemisorption of Methylene Blue on the bead surface. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads showed higher degradation for Methylene Blue and Nile Blue A than Rhodamine B in 5 and 50 ppm each multicomponent dye systems under UV irradiation. The κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads could form a porous column for the selective adsorption of positively charged dyes from a multicomponent dye system. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers.</td>\n",

A hybrid nanocomposite has also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the κC-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species. The study indicates that the synthesized adsorbents have potential applications for the removal of dyes and metal ions from wastewater. © 2020</td>\n",

The ZHC was synthesized via the graft-copolymerization technique using the crosslinked hydrogel of KC as polymer matrix. Effects of incorporating zeolite particles within the hydrogel matrix on the properties were studied using different characterization techniques such as TEM, X-ray diffraction, SEM and FTIR. The hydrogel composite with 8% loading of zeolite exhibited maximum swelling capacity (3.481%) among the synthesized ZHCs. For MB removal, ZHC adsorbed 99% dye with 0.4 g L−1 adsorbent dose in the neutral pH solution. Furthermore, the adsorption of MB onto ZHC followed pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A novel superabsorbent composite based on kappa-Carrageenan (κC) was prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylamide (AAm) onto κC in the presence of bentonite powder using methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinking agent, ammonium persulfate (APS) as an initiator, and sodium carbonate as a pore-forming agent. The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased. The swelling rate of the hydrogels was improved by introducing sodium carbonate as pore-forming agent. The prepared superadsorbent composites were used as adsorbent for a cationic dye, methylene blue. Isotherm of adsorption and the effect of pH, adsorption dosage, contact time and initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were also studied. The results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue on the prepared adsorbents is 156.25 mg g−1 and adsorption is well-described by Langmuir isotherm model. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.</td>\n",

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)</td>\n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration. As per Langmuir model, maximum adsorption was observed to be 132 mg/g for Ala: Car: GO ratio of 2:2:1. The dye absorption followed langmuir adsorption isotherm. The synthesized hydrogel beads show multi-functionalities (double network of polymers and graphene oxide) as such may potentially be used for removal of harmful dyes from the waste water as well as from aqueous waters. © 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers</td>\n",

In this work, we have used repeated alkali solubilization and acid precipitation for an agricultural and forestry by-product, bilberry kernel shells, to obtain Mountain apricot shell Melanin (Mas-Mel), which can be used for the adsorption of cationic dyes. By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles.

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process.

Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking.

              "      <td>Methylene blue (MB), a common dye in the textile industry, has a multitude of detrimental consequences on humans and the environment. Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

              "      <td>A composite hydrogel displaying pH sensitivity was successfully prepared from bamboo cellulose extracted from bamboo off-cuts, with added κ-carrageenan (κ-CN) by inverse suspension polymerization, and using epichlorohydrin (ECH) as a crosslinking agent. The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A novel ternary blended polymer composed of cost-effective and readily available polymers was synthesized using poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), iota carrageenan (IC), and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023</td>\n",

              "      <td>This study addresses the critical issue of removing toxic dyes from industrial wastewater to protect the environment and human health. To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&amp;#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&amp;#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&amp;#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&amp;#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</td>\n",

The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively.

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites. The experimental equilibrated adsorption capacity of nanocomposites was analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The results corroborated that the experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm the best.</td>\n",

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic. The polymeric microspheres can be employed to deliver drugs in a rate-controlled and sometimes targeted manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022</td>\n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.</td>\n",

FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol.

              "      <td>The contamination of water by organic dye compounds are worldwide environmental problem due to their highly toxic nature. To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.</td>\n",

The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° < 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.   \n",

In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.   \n",

The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces.

Polysaccharide-based gel beads are preferred for their uniform shape and size, large specific surface area, and easy separation by filtration and subsequent reuse. In this work, we prepare and rheologically characterize UV-active κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads for the adsorption and degradation of dyes. The 3–4 mm sized nanocomposite beads are formed by the extrusion of κ-carrageenan/TiO2 gel solution in salt solutions. The maximum increase in modulus was observed with the addition of 1% w/v TiO2 to κ-carrageenan and subsequent crosslinking with mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads crosslinked by mixed salt of KCl and CaCl2 have higher adsorption capacity, as compared to beads crosslinked with single salt of KCl. The kinetic study indicated the chemisorption of Methylene Blue on the bead surface. κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads showed higher degradation for Methylene Blue and Nile Blue A than Rhodamine B in 5 and 50 ppm each multicomponent dye systems under UV irradiation. The κ-carrageenan/TiO2 beads could form a porous column for the selective adsorption of positively charged dyes from a multicomponent dye system. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers.   \n",

A hybrid nanocomposite has also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the κC-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD, SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species. The study indicates that the synthesized adsorbents have potential applications for the removal of dyes and metal ions from wastewater. © 2020   \n",

The ZHC was synthesized via the graft-copolymerization technique using the crosslinked hydrogel of KC as polymer matrix. Effects of incorporating zeolite particles within the hydrogel matrix on the properties were studied using different characterization techniques such as TEM, X-ray diffraction, SEM and FTIR. The hydrogel composite with 8% loading of zeolite exhibited maximum swelling capacity (3.481%) among the synthesized ZHCs. For MB removal, ZHC adsorbed 99% dye with 0.4 g L−1 adsorbent dose in the neutral pH solution. Furthermore, the adsorption of MB onto ZHC followed pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.   \n",

The CP was synthesized free radically from its monomers N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), acrylic acid (AA) and methylene bis-acrylamide (MBA) crosslinker comonomer in the presence of KC in water. The adsorbents were characterized and used for separation of Safranine T (ST) and brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) cationic dye mixtures from water. The synthesis and process parameters for adsorption were optimized with central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Accordingly, the CPKC bio-composite adsorbent with optimized composition of 2.5 wt% of KC, 1.5 wt% of MBA and NVP: AA molar ratio of 1.3:1 showed a high adsorption capacity of 362.5 mg/g for ST and 398 mg/g of BCB dye for a binary mixture containing 100 mg/L each of the dye in a solution pH of 7 and adsorbent dose of 0.25 g/L. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased. The swelling rate of the hydrogels was improved by introducing sodium carbonate as pore-forming agent. The prepared superadsorbent composites were used as adsorbent for a cationic dye, methylene blue. Isotherm of adsorption and the effect of pH, adsorption dosage, contact time and initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were also studied. The results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of methylene blue on the prepared adsorbents is 156.25 mg g−1 and adsorption is well-described by Langmuir isotherm model. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.   \n",

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)   \n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration.

In this work, we have used repeated alkali solubilization and acid precipitation for an agricultural and forestry by-product, bilberry kernel shells, to obtain Mountain apricot shell Melanin (Mas-Mel), which can be used for the adsorption of cationic dyes. By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles. Our results may provide a new strategy for the development of green bio-based adsorbent materials and industrial dye wastewater treatment. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers   \n",

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process.

Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking.

Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd   \n",

The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.   \n",

Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023   \n",
              "17  This study addresses the critical issue of removing toxic dyes from industrial wastewater to protect the environment and human health. To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&#x02009;±&#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&#x02009;±&#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.   \n",

The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite showed a much higher adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) than the cellulose and cellulose/TiO2 composite. The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite also degraded MB more efficiently in aqueous solution than the cellulose/ TiO2 composite. The MB adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite increased linearly with increasing carrageenan content in the composites. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.   \n",

Novel carrageenan and itaconic acid-based superadsorbent hydrogel having appreciable swelling properties and adsorption capacity towards Methylene blue (MB), Crystal violet (CV), and Methyl Red (MR) was synthesized by suspension polymerization technique. The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively. Thermodynamic studies revealed the spontaneous nature of the undertaken dye adsorption experiment. Overall, the present study reveals that the synthesized superadsorbent hydrogel can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of dyes from an aqueous solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.   \n",

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites. The experimental equilibrated adsorption capacity of nanocomposites was analyzed using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The results corroborated that the experimental data fit the Langmuir isotherm the best.   \n",

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic.

Under optimized reaction conditions, GT-CAG-cl-polyAA displayed 486 % maximum swelling percentage. TEM image depicted wrinkled silk veil wave-type surface morphology of graphene oxide (GO), whereas, the SEM analysis indicated the porous nature of the GT-CAG-cl-polyAA and GOHNC capable of accumulating a large number of water/dye molecules. GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022   \n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.   \n",

Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol.

To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.   \n",

The results showed that the viscosity and the shear strain resistance of the CAS/CR/SA hybrid hydrogels positively correlated with their sodium alginate contents. The hybrid hydrogels with high carrageenan contents exhibited a high energy storage modulus (G') and a high loss modulus (G\"). The swelling and methylene blue adsorption experiments showed that the CAS/CR/SA hydrogels had pH and temperature sensitivity. The hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium in 12 h (alkaline conditions) and 24–36 h (acidic conditions). The adsorption kinetics of the hybrid hydrogels showed that their adsorption process was mainly controlled by chemisorption and that adsorption was exothermic (ΔH° &lt; 0). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

              "      <td>κ-Carrageenan (κC) is a widely used food hydrogel, but its use as an environmental adsorption separation material still needs to be further developed. Herein, a novel macroporous anionic monolith was synthesized by the oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion template method. The monolith was obtained by the continuous phase polymerization of sodium styrenesulfonate (NaSS) and acrylic acid (AA), in which κC was introduced to form a semi-interpenetrating network structure to improve its overall performance. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the monolith increased with κC content. Because of the use of two strong hydrophilic monomers, NaSS and AA, the porous monolith proved to be superoleophobic underwater. In addition, the porous materials had a strong cationic dye adsorption capacity (2455 mg/g for malachite green, 1180 mg/g for methylene blue) and a fast removal rate, good reusability, and oil–water separation. This work highlights their potential application value in the purification of complex water environments. © 2024 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</td>\n",

In this work, a new biopolymeric-based hydrogel of κ-carrageenan/poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (CG/PG) was prepared for adsorptive removal of cationic methylene blue (MB) as a toxic dye model. The physicochemical properties and morphology of the hydrogel beads were characterized by swelling test, FT-IR, TGA and SEM. Parameters affecting the adsorption of MB from aqueous solution such as CG/PG ratios, initial dye concentration, solution pH, time, adsorbent dosage and solution temperature were investigated in a batch system. Incorporation of PG with reactive function groups into the CG matrix was proven to enhance the adsorption capacity and stability of the hydrogel required for the application of adsorbent as compared to the pristine CG biopolymer. The experimental adsorption followed pseudo-second order model and well fitted with Langmuir isotherm, with maximum MB adsorption of 166.62 mg g-1. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process was spontaneous and exothermic. The beads could be easily regenerated after washing with ethanol and reused for at least five adsorption-desorption cycles with high efficiency. The fabrication of CG/PG hydrogel beads provided a feasible strategy for the design and modification of bio-based polymers in the field of wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.</td>\n",

The structural features of the hydrogel was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The presence of both biopolymers in the hydrogel was confirmed by the O–H stretching of BC at 3390 cm−1 and the sulfate group (-SO3) of κ-C at 1226 cm−1. Scanning electron microscope images of the hydrogel showed A 3-D network of fibrils with high porosity. The enhanced swelling capacity of the hydrogel in water at pH 7 is due to the combined number of hydrophilic groups from BC and κ-C. The conductivity of the hydrogel increased with increasing κ-C due to the increased number of sulfate groups (-SO3). The hydrogel had the ability to adsorb organic dyes; Congo red, Crystal violet and Methylene blue from neutral water at 27 °C. All the dyes fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model and followed both the Langmuir and the Freundlich adsorption isotherms indicating monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The ΔGoad was negative indicating spontaneous physisorption for the three dyes. The prepared hydrogel being environmentally friendly also showed an improved ability to adsorb the organic dyes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.</td>\n",

The nanocomposite exhibited super-paramagnetic behavior. The κC-g-PHEAA and κC-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4 presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G (R6G); and metal ions, Cu(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg(II). The adsorption was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient recovery of adsorbate species.

The ZHC exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 661.91 at 298.18 K, 674.05 at 308.15 K and 682.67 mgdye gads−1 at 318.15 K. Dye diffusion mechanism partially followed both liquid film and intra-particle diffusion mechanisms. Results obtained from thermodynamics experiments suggested the endothermic nature of the MB adsorption on ZHC. MB was selectively adsorbed from the binary dye mixtures having MB and methyl orange in different concentration ratio. In addition, the ZHC showed excellent adsorption behavior for six continuous adsorption–desorption cycles. Therefore, the synthesized ZHC has all the properties to be used as a potential adsorbent for the treatment of cationic dyes contaminated wastewater. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</td>\n",

The swelling behavior in distilled water and in solutions with different pH values was investigated. The results indicated that with increasing carrageenan/bentonite weight ratio, the swelling capacity is increased but the gel content is decreased. The swelling rate of the hydrogels was improved by introducing sodium carbonate as pore-forming agent. The prepared superadsorbent composites were used as adsorbent for a cationic dye, methylene blue. Isotherm of adsorption and the effect of pH, adsorption dosage, contact time and initial dye concentration on dye adsorption were also studied.

For this, novel kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (kC/PVA) composites with modified pumice were made. Using the freezing-thawing procedure, the mixture of polymers and modified pumice was cross-linked, and then K+ ions were added. Using SEM, FTIR, and XRD methods, the structure of the resultant hydrogel composites was identified. Using a batch adsorption technique, the effects of contact time, changed pumice content, temperature, pH, ion strength, and dye solution salinity on the adsorption of cationic methylene blue dye on the hydrogel composites were examined. The swelling capacity of the resultant hydrogels was found to be lower than that of modified pumice-free hydrogels, falling from 780 to 470 %. The number of salts CaCl2 and AlCl3 in the solution dramatically reduced the adsorption capacity from 24.61 to 19 and 17 correspondingly. The greatest adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composites achieved was 185.65 mg g-1, and equilibrium dye adsorption data were also found to follow the Langmuir model. Based on the results of this study, synthetic hydrogel composites can be used as inexpensive adsorbents to remove colors from aqueous solutions, such as commercial dye baths. ©2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)</td>\n",

Here we prepared Graphene oxide based Sodium Alginate-Carrageenan (Ala-Car) hydrogel beads using copper metal ions as ionic crosslinker. The hydrogel beads were prepared by injecting bio-polymers into a beaker containing Cu2+ ions following rapid magnetic bead strategy. The shape and mechanical properties of hydrogel beads were influenced by concentration of copper ions and amount of the biopolymers used. Rheological and textural analysis was carried to investigate the mechanical and deformation studies of the hydrogel beads and the concentration of copper ions was optimized accordingly. Structural and morphological characterization was done by using FTIR and FESEM analysis. The hydrogels showed high removal capacity than the reported hydrogels of sodium alginate for methylene blue (MB) removal. Keeping the dosage of the adsorbent concentration constant (Ala:Car:GO = 2:2:1) and pH 9.2 conditions, percent removal ranged between 70% and 80% at lower concentrations and went upto about 90% at 60 mg/L of the initial dye concentration. As per Langmuir model, maximum adsorption was observed to be 132 mg/g for Ala: Car: GO ratio of 2:2:1. The dye absorption followed langmuir adsorption isotherm.

By graft copolymerization with a natural sugar-based polymer, κ-carrageenan (κCA), in a mild manner, we have prepared the adsorbent, Mountain apricot shell Melanin /κ-carrageenan (Mas-Mel/κCA) hydrogel beads, which were physically and chemically analyzed using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The optimum conditions for methylene blue (MB) adsorption and malachite green (MG) on Mas-Mel/κCA hydrogel were: contact time 150 min, adsorbent dose 60 mg, pH 6–7. The results of the adsorption tests followed the Pseudo-second order kinetics (R2 = 0.97 and 0.95), and the maximum adsorption capacity of MB and MG based on the Langmuir isotherm model was 48.63 mg/g and 37.84 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the prepared hydrogel beads still exhibited a high reusability and removal rate (∼50 %) after three consecutive 400-minute cyclic adsorption-resolution cycles.

The combination of DTAB and CAR was validated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, while the folded surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope. DTAB can be used as a modifier of CAR for promoting the hydrophobicity and stability of hydrogel beads, which even withstood 70°C in water for 24 h without dissociation. The best removal efficiency was achieved 99.6% in 100 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution by CAR-0.5DTAB, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CAR-1.5DTAB at 30°C reached 38.6 mg g−1 by wet weight (weight of gel beads in wet condition) in 2000 mg L−1 MB aqueous solution. The CAR-DTAB adsorption behavior was best fitted with pseudo-first-order and Langmuir equations, respectively. The exothermic nature and spontaneity of adsorption process were proved by thermodynamic experiment. Reusability studies revealed that the adsorption performance displayed almost no change after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption process.

              "      <td>The study explores the use of hydrochar-derived activated carbon (AC) to improve the adsorption capacity and mechanical properties of carrageenan (CAR) hydrogel beads. Four distinct samples, with carrageenan to activated carbon ratios of 1:0 (CAR), 2:1 (CAC2), 4:1 (CAC4), and 10:1 (CAC10), were prepared. These polymeric beads underwent comprehensive evaluation for their methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity, gel content (GC), and swelling ratio (SR). Increasing activated carbon content up to 50 % of carrageenan mass significantly enhanced GC and SR by 20.57 % and 429.24 %, respectively. Various analytical techniques were employed to characterize the composites, including FTIR, XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and EDS-Mapping. Batch adsorption tests investigated the effects of pH, contact time, dye concentration, and temperature on MB adsorption. Maximum adsorption capacities for CAR, CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2 were 475.48, 558.54, 635.93, and 552.35 mg/g, respectively, under optimal conditions. Kinetic models (Elovich and pseudo-second-order) and isotherm models (Temkin for CAR and Freundlich for CAC10, CAC4, and CAC2) fitted well with the experimental data. Thermodynamic analysis showed spontaneous, exothermic MB adsorption. Primary mechanisms include electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, n-π, and π-π stacking. The study highlights enhanced adsorption capacity of carrageenan hydrogel via carrageenan/activated carbon composites, providing cost-effective wastewater treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Methylene blue (MB), a common dye in the textile industry, has a multitude of detrimental consequences on humans and the environment. Accordingly, it is necessary to remove dyes from water to guarantee our health and sustainable ecosystem. In this study, we developed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel adsorbents with high adsorption capacity by adding three types of carrageenan (kappa, iota, and lambda) to remove MB from water. Thanks to the functional groups, the PVA/carrageenan membranes dramatically increased the removal efficiency (kappa, 98.8%; iota, 97.0%; lambda, 95.4%) compared to the pure PVA membrane (6.3%). Among the three types of PVA/carrageenan membranes, the PVA/kappa-carrageenan membrane exhibited the best adsorption capacity of 147.8 mg/g. This result implies that steric hindrance was considerably significant, given that kappa carrageenan has only one sulfate group in the repeating unit, whereas iota and lambda carrageenan composite PVA membranes possess two and three sulfate groups. Apart from the maximum adsorption capacity, this study addressed a variety of characteristics of PVA/carrageenan membranes such as the effects of initial MB concentration, kappa carrageenan weight percentage, contact time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature on the adsorption performance. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also carried out. Lastly, the reusability of the PVA/carrageenan membrane was verified by the 98% removal efficiency maintained after five adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

The prepared composite hydrogels and their swelling kinetics were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, methylene blue was used as a model drug molecule to study the effects of different initial concentrations and initial pH values on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel. The results of these analyses showed that modified bamboo cellulose and κ-CN underwent chemical cross-linking, forming a hydrogel with a three-dimensional network structure with a fixed decomposition temperature. The hydrogel showed pH-sensitive swelling behavior, caused by the variations in electrostatic repulsion exhibited by its negatively-charged side chain groups in solutions with varying pH. The initial swelling phase complied with the Fickian diffusion model, while the entire swelling process complied with the Schott model. The hydrogel was porous and displayed swelling capacity, which enabled it to express high adsorption capacity. The adsorption test showed it had a high adsorption capacity to the model drug (methylene blue). Therefore, this composite hydrogel could potentially be applied to facilitate drug adsorption and sustained release. ©, 2015, South China University of Technology. All right reserved.</td>\n",

Sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), prepared from recycled drinking water bottles, was utilized as a doping agent. Varying amounts (1–3 wt%) were combined into the polymer matrix. The produced hydrogel film was examined as a potential adsorbent hydrogel film for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and Gentamicin sulfate (GMS) antibiotic from an aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrate that the presence of SGO significantly increased the adsorption efficiency of PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the PVA/IC/PVP-3% SGO hydrogel film exhibited the most potent activity against all the tested pathogenic bacteria. However, the adsorption results for MB and GMS showed that the addition of 3 wt% SGO resulted in a removal percentage that was a two fold increase in the removal percentage compared with the undoped PVA/IC/PVP hydrogel film. Furthermore, the response surface methodology (RSM) model was utilized to examine and optimize several operating parameters, including time, pH of the solution, and initial pollutant concentration. The adsorption kinetics were better characterized by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The composite film containing 3 wt% SGO had a maximum adsorption capacity of 606 mg g−1 for MB and 654 mg g−1 for GMS, respectively. The generated nanocomposite hydrogel film demonstrated promising potential for application in water purification systems. © 2023</td>\n",

To address this challenge, a bio-based composite hydrogel was synthesized using gamma irradiation, 20 kGy, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes@pectin/κ-carrageenan/polyacrylic acid (MWCNTs PC/KC/PAAc) for removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions. The prepared composites underwent characterization through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area upon the addition of MWCNTs. Specifically, the surface area increased from 342.5 m2 g−1 for PC/KC/PAAc to 689.5 m2 g−1 when 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs were added. Also, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy were utilized to examine the surface topography of PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. The results reveal that at 0.175&amp;#x02009;wt% of MWCNTs, there was a more uniform surface topography with well-distributed MWCNTs within the matrix. In the adsorption study of MB dye, it was found that the highest MB removal efficiency was achieved at pH&amp;#x02009;11, with values of 68.21% and 96% for PC/KC/PAAc and MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, respectively. Furthermore, upon studying the effect of MWCNTs (%), the results showed that the removal (%) of PC/KC/PAAc was 68.21&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;1.02%, and this percentage increased rapidly with the addition of MWCNTs, reaching a maximum of 96&amp;#x02009;±&amp;#x02009;0.85% when 0.175 (wt%) of MWCNTs was added. Isotherm and kinetic modeling demonstrated that MB adsorption follows the Freundlich isotherm for PC/KC/PAAc and the Redlich–Peterson isotherm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc, both following a pseudo-second-order kinetics model. In addition, from AFM data, after MB removal, the height increased significantly from 322&amp;#x02009;nm for PC/KC/PAAc to 810&amp;#x02009;nm for MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc (0.175&amp;#x02009;wt%), indicating a substantially higher adsorption of MB by MWCNTs@PC/KC/PAAc. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</td>\n",

The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite showed a much higher adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) than the cellulose and cellulose/TiO2 composite. The cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite also degraded MB more efficiently in aqueous solution than the cellulose/ TiO2 composite. The MB adsorption capacity of the cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 composite increased linearly with increasing carrageenan content in the composites. © 2017, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</td>\n",

Novel carrageenan and itaconic acid-based superadsorbent hydrogel having appreciable swelling properties and adsorption capacity towards Methylene blue (MB), Crystal violet (CV), and Methyl Red (MR) was synthesized by suspension polymerization technique. The swelling study showed the dependency upon the temperature in which the swelling rate increased with increasing temperature with a maximum swelling rate of 417% at 318 K. For ascertaining the maximum adsorption capacity, various influential parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dose, dye concentration, and temperature were systematically studied. Maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 2439.02, 1111.11, and 666.68 mg/g for MB, CV, and MR, respectively. Thermodynamic studies revealed the spontaneous nature of the undertaken dye adsorption experiment. Overall, the present study reveals that the synthesized superadsorbent hydrogel can be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of dyes from an aqueous solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were investigated using XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained nanocomposites were examined to remove cationic methylene blue (MB) dye from water. The effect of clay content on the rate of dye adsorption revealed that the rate of dye adsorption enhanced by introduction of nanoclay in hydrogel composition. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic predominated for the adsorption of MB onto nanocomposites.

The prepared hydrogel beads were examined by FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA analysis, which well confirmed their successful impregnation by the surfactants. The results revealed that the spherical/cubic CRG-TTX hydrogels have a higher crystal structure and thermal resistance than spherical CRG-SDBS. It was demonstrated that the impregnation of CRG hydrogel beads with TXX and SDBS surfactants improves their adsorption behavior toward methylene blue (MB) from aqueous media. The surfactant amount significantly effects on adsorbent performance, whereas the best surfactant concentration was found to be half of the critical micellar concentration. The optimum concentration of adsorbents was obtained 1 g L−1, and the best removal efficiencies were achieved in the pH range of 4 to 8. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained 482.15 mg g−1 and 469.57 at 45 °C for CRG-TTX and CRG-SDBS, respectively. The dye adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the obtained adsorption experimental data were in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Thermodynamic study indicated that the process was spontaneous in nature and endothermic.

TEM image depicted wrinkled silk veil wave-type surface morphology of graphene oxide (GO), whereas, the SEM analysis indicated the porous nature of the GT-CAG-cl-polyAA and GOHNC capable of accumulating a large number of water/dye molecules. GT-CAG-cl-polyAA exhibited 96.11 % and 82.16 % dye removal potential for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and coomassie brilliant blue (CB), respectively under optimized conditions. GOHNC enhanced the % dye removal efficiency (98.39 % for MB and 94.50 % for CB). The maximum adsorption capacity of GOHNC for the removal of CB and MB was 312.7 mg/g and 94.9 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption of CB and MB exhibited best fitting with Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherms data. The negative values of ΔG° and positive values of ΔS° which were obtained from the adsorption isotherm plot suggested the thermodynamic feasibility of the adsorption. Also, the samples were reusable for up to five consecutive cycles without any degradation and hence suggested a considerable pathway for the separation of textile dyes. © 2022</td>\n",

The incorporation of modifying biopolymer significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity of the cellulose/TiO2 beads. Cellulose/carrageenan/TiO2 beads exhibited a 7.0-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB). In contrast, cellulose/chitosan/TiO2 beads showed a 4.8-fold increase in adsorption capacity for methyl orange (MO) compared with cellulose/TiO2 beads. In addition, cellulose/TiO2 microbeads were prepared through the sol–gel transition of the [Emim][Ac]-in-oil emulsion to enhance photodegradation activity. These microbeads displayed a 4.6-fold higher adsorption capacity and 2.8-fold higher photodegradation activity for MB than the millimeter-sized beads. Furthermore, they exhibited superior dye removal efficiencies for various dyes such as Congo red, MO, MB, crystal violet, and rhodamine B, surpassing the performance of larger beads. To expand the industrial applicability of the microbeads, biopolymer/TiO2 magnetic microbeads were developed by incorporating Fe2O3. These magnetic microbeads outperformed millimeter-sized beads regarding the efficiency and time required for MB removal from aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of magnetic microbeads can be easily controlled by adjusting the type of biopolymer modifier, the TiO2 and magnetic particle content, and the ratio of each component based on the target molecule. Therefore, biopolymer-based photocatalytic magnetic microbeads have great potential not only in environmental fields but also in biomedical fields. © 2023 by the authors.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Water pollution caused by dyes is a significant global problem. Adsorption technique is successfully applied for the removal of dyes from water. In this technique, the use of effective adsorbents is very important. Here, agar/κ-carrageenan composite hydrogel adsorbent prepared through free radical cross-linking reaction in the presence of tri (ethylene glycol) divinyl ether as a cross-linker and characterized by using FTIR, SEM and TGA measurements was used to remove Methylene Blue from water. FTIR results exhibited that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding formation were the main interactions in the adsorptive removal of Methylene Blue by agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Pseudo second order and Langmuir models were found to be the most suitable kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. Maximum dye adsorption capacity of 242.3 mg·g−1 was obtained at 35 °C and pH 7. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to understand the nature of adsorption process. Different solvents were applied for the regeneration of dye adsorbed-agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel and the most suitable solvent was determined as ethyl alcohol. The results demonstrated that agar/κ-carrageenan hydrogel is a promising adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes from water. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The contamination of water by organic dye compounds are worldwide environmental problem due to their highly toxic nature. To address this environmental issue, a simple technique with highly efficient dye removal was developed to prepare pH- sensitive dual-crosslinked anionic and amphoteric interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels based on Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) using jute stick-based cellulose. Crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked κ-carrageenan (KC) were interlaced by H-bonding in anionic IPN hydrogel (An-gel), but crosslinked Na-CMC and crosslinked Chitosan (CS) were interlaced by electrostatic interaction in amphoteric IPN hydrogel (Am-gel). In various operating conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) An-gel displayed a higher number of swelling ratios of about 2560% at pH 7.2 and Am-gel of about 1874% at pH 5.5. Based on the point of zero charge, An-gel achieved the maximum removal efficiency of 81.62 % for methylene blue (MB) at pH 7.2, whereas Am-gel achieved 85.38% removal efficiency for eosin yellow (EY) at pH 5.5. The adsorption kinetics of IPN hydrogels followed a pseudo-second order model and best fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The removal efficiency of MB and EY decreased slightly with increasing temperature. The values of ΔH°, ΔG°, and ΔS° indicated an exothermic, spontaneous, and disordered adsorption process. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.</td>\n",
